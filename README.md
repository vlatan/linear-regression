# Regression Analysis

A notebook used for generating the plots used in 
[this article](https://netrewrite.com/posts/layman-machine-learning-explanation/). 

It basically generates random linear and parabolic data and then it fits various curves 
(polynomials with different degrees) in that data. In other words it trains bunch of different 
regression models and compares their precision. It also compares the differences in 
models' r-squared errors between training and new data. In doing so it brings up the question 
about underfitting and overfitting.
